# CrewClaw

> 🧠 The Control Plane for Team-based OpenClaw Workspaces

CrewClaw is an open-source platform that enables teams to **securely provision, manage, and scale OpenClaw workspaces per user**, with a clean separation between control plane, runtime orchestration, and runtime environments.

Built for teams—not just individuals.

---

## ✨ Why CrewClaw?

OpenClaw is powerful, but running it for a **team** introduces real challenges:

* How do you manage **multiple users and workspaces**?
* How do you isolate environments per user?
* How do you handle **invitation flows, roles, and permissions**?
* How do you securely expose runtime UIs?
* How do you scale runtime lifecycle (start/stop/recover)?

CrewClaw solves all of this.

---

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

CrewClaw follows a **boundary-first architecture**: browser ingress, identity, control plane, runtime orchestration, per-user runtimes, and a unified model layer are kept distinct.

At a high level:

  v
Traefik -> Authentik -> CrewClaw Control Plane -> Runtime Orchestrator -> Runtime Manager -> Per-user OpenClaw Runtime
                                      |
                                      +-> Model Service / Credential Proxy -> LiteLLM -> vLLM / Ollama / upstream providers
                                      |
                                      +-> PostgreSQL
```

### Layers

| Layer | Components | Role |
| ----- | ---------- | ---- |
| Entry | Traefik + Authentik | Routing, login, session verification, subdomain protection |
| Platform | CrewClaw control plane + web UI | User sync, runtime truth, admin governance, workspace entry |
| Orchestration | Runtime orchestrator + runtime manager | Desired-state reconciliation, config rendering, container lifecycle |
| Runtime | Per-user OpenClaw runtime | User workspace, profiles, agent runtime |
| Model | LiteLLM + PostgreSQL + vLLM/Ollama | Unified model access, credential proxying, usage aggregation |

**Key design notes** (MVP): one runtime per user; `browserUrl` (user-facing) and `internalEndpoint` (platform/internal) stay separate; workspace URLs remain authenticated via Traefik/Authentik; the control plane does not directly operate the Docker socket—container lifecycle belongs to the runtime manager.

For the full picture, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

### 1. Control Plane (CrewClaw)

* User / Workspace / Role management
* Invitation system
* Runtime lifecycle as *business truth*
* Integration with Authentik (identity)
* Admin + User dashboard

### 2. Runtime Orchestration (RuntimeManager)

* Create / start / stop / delete runtimes
* Container lifecycle management
* Health checks & state reporting
* Stateless execution layer

### 3. Runtime Environment (OpenClaw Docker)

* Per-user isolated runtime
* Mounted workspace
* Browser-accessible UI

```
User → CrewClaw → RuntimeManager → Runtime (OpenClaw)
```

## 💡 Design Principles

* **Separation of concerns first**
* **Control plane owns truth**
* **Runtime is disposable**
* **Stateless orchestration layer**
* **Security by default**

## 🔥 Vision

CrewClaw aims to become the **standard control plane for team-based AI workspaces**, starting with OpenClaw.

We are not just building a tool.

We are defining a **new way to run collaborative AI environments at scale**.
